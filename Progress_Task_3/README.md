# Progress Task 3

## Task Description

The objective of this task is to analyze and compare the narratives of disinformers and those of trustworthy sources within the X dataset related to COVID-19. This involves identifying potential differences in linguistic patterns, themes, or other distinguishing features that characterize disinformation versus credible information.

To develop this task, we will use different NLP techniques to analyze the text data. Such as:

- TODO

- BERTopic for topic modeling

To visualize the results, we will use different graphical representations.
