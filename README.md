## Progress Task 3

**How do disinformers write? An unsupervised approach for stylistics characterization of false information spreaders.**

The objective of this task is to analyze and compare the narratives of disinformers and those of trustworthy sources within the X dataset related to COVID-19. This involves identifying potential differences in linguistic patterns, themes, or other distinguishing features that characterize disinformation versus credible information.
