    "\n",
    "In an attempt to achieve competitive advancements, the team decided to use some alternative models that were not present under the scikit-learn library. The LightGBM model is a decision-tree-based model from the library `lightgbm`. Given the good performance of catboost and the similarity of this other model to it, the team decided to try it out."

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) is a gradient boosting framework that uses tree-based learning algorithms. It is designed for distributed and efficient gradient boosting, **performing even faster than catboost**. Working within the `lightgbm` library, developers are able to use the model on datasets of millions of samples efficiently, with a set of high-efficiency parameters. The model is also able to handle a methodology called \"feature_fraction\" which allows it to only handle a set of features within each iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "LightGBM uses a leave-based growth strategy, always selecting the best leaf node to divide. This approach may achieve competitive advantage over other models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strengths\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Speed**: LightGBM is known for its speed and efficiency, being able to handle large datasets with millions of samples.\n",
    "* **High accuracy**: its leaf-based growth strategy allows it to achieve high accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Weaknesses\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Overfitting**: LightGBM is known to overfit on smaller datasets, so it is important to tune the hyperparameters correctly.\n",
    "* **Sensitivity to disbalanced datasets**: class ponderation may be required."
