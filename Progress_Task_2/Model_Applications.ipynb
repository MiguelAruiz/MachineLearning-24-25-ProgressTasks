    "\n",
    "🤖: All of them are not native sklearn.   \n",

    "**LightGBM**: Faster than XGBoost in many cases, especially for large and high-dimensional datasets, handles categorical data natively (no encoding required), however can be sensitive to imbalanced data.   \n",
    "**CatBoost**: Handles categorical features directly, often reduces overfitting automatically but has slower initial training compared to LightGBM.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. How does Catboost encode categorical variables? Is it worth we manually encode the dataset?  \n",
    "\n",
    "🤖: No, it's better to use Catboost, let me explain why. Catboost natively uses a technique called 'target-based adaptative encoding' to deal with categorical variables internally. This means that while training, Catboost calculates statistics based on the target variable to encode the features. These statistics are calculated online to prevent leakage information.\n",

    "1. Communication  \n",
    "Our main challenge was the lack of communication between the team members. Each one of us was busy during the course and in vacations we were all spending time with our families, which made it difficult to organize our work. We could have improved the repo' structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Plan in advanced   \n",
    "Another problem was not having clearly defined what tests we wanted to run. Luckily, one of the teammates insisted on using MLflow, which was incredibly useful to solve this problem. However, in future competitions we should plan in advance which models and tests will be used and share a table to store the results, as all members are supposed to be executing the models.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Dataset size  \n",
    "It was our first time working with a dataset as big as this, with 26700 instances. It was a little difficult to preprocess the dataset because of its huge dimensionality and we had to be very patient because some models took too long to run. This task had a high computational cost both in time and resources.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Competitiveness   \n",
    "At first, we thought everyone will be using the techniques learnt in class, however, other classmates were ranking higher (maybe using other models), so we had no choice but to step up. At the end, this is a competition but we felt like the rules weren't clear enough. This means that, we can compete with others but among us (the class) it would have been nice to know in advance which was allowed.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Optuna   \n",
    "Despite all of that, we have discovered an extraordinary tool, Optuna. It's very useful for optimizing hyperparameter search, and it allowed us to use the laptop while the training is executing. Also, you can save the execution of the study reload it any time. It would have been very useful to know about this tool from the beginning."
