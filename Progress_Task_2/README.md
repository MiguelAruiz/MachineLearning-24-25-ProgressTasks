# Progress Task 2

## Task Description

The objective is to build a predictive model that estimates the likelihood of individuals receiving two different vaccines: the H1N1 flu vaccine and the seasonal flu vaccine.

All the information about the task is on the following site: [competition website](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/66/flu-shot-learning/page/210/)
